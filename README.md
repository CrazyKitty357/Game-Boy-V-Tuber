# How to use  
Using this software is pretty easy, there are 2 python scripts one called getmic.py which gets your mic and the other being voice.py which does the voice inputs. First run getmic.py to see which number corrosponds to your mic. Next edit the device_index variable in voice.py, you can also change how sensitive your mouth movement is by changing pressed_threshold and released_threshold variables. To change your model you can edit the bundled GBStudio project which is the GameBoy folder with GBStudio 3.2.1
